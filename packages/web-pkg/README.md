# web-pkg

`web-pkg` is a package that provides utilities, most importantly a variety of components and composables, that can be useful when developing apps and extensions for ownCloud Web.

It's important to note that this package solely provides types because `web-pkg` is intended solely for Web extension development. The actual implementation of the utilities is provided by the Web runtime automatically.

```
$ npm install @ownclouders/web-pkg

$ pnpm add @ownclouders/web-pkg
