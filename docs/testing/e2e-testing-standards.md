In ownCloud, we use Playwright for webUI test automation. We benefit from lower barriers to entry, readability, and usability when test standards are consistent across repositories. For example:

- **Reusability:** Enhances reusability by making it easier to reuse functions, locators, shared steps, and other test code. Finding the necessary components and functionalities will be simple for someone working on a test resulting in reduced duplication and the requirement for rework after the initiation of a code review.

- **Facilitates reviews:** Code can be examined more quickly. Since you can quickly determine what the test code is doing, it eases the mental strain of code review.

- **Faster onboarding:** By following naming conventions, new contributors are onboarded more rapidly and feel comfortable enough to contribute to the codebase.

Here are the test standards and guidelines we adhere to when creating Playwright tests at ownCloud.

## Folder Structure:
- `tests/:`

    - `e2e/`: Main folder containing all (end-to-end) E2E test-related files.

        - `features/`: Contains Gherkin feature files.

            - `<test-suite-folder>/`: Collection house for "**related"** feature files.

                - `<aFeatureFile>.feature`: A feature file.

        - `page-objects/`: Contains the Page Object classes.

            - `<specific-page-object-folder>/`: Collection house for related page objects for each webpage or component

                - `<individualPageObject>.ts`: Page Object for each webpage or component.

        - `steps/`: Holds the step definition files for mapping Gherkin steps to code.

            - `<stepDefinition>.ts`: Step definitions for each feature.

        - `utils/`: Utility functions and common helpers.

            - `helpers.ts`: Common utility functions (e.g., date formatting, data generation).

        - `config/`: Configuration files for Playwright and other tools.

            - `playwright.config.ts`: Playwright configuration.

        - `hooks/`: Cucumber hooks for setting up and tearing down test environments.

            - `hooks.ts`: Contains `Before`, `After`, and other lifecycle hooks.

        - `reports/`: Generated test reports (e.g., HTML, JSON).

            - `screenshots/`: Captured screenshots during test execution.

            - `videos/`: Recorded videos of test runs.

        - `test-data/`: Static test data files or folders for upload.

            - `data.json`: Example JSON files or CSVs with test data.

## Test Structure - Arrange, Act, Assert:

We can follow the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern when structuring the tests. In most cases, the Arrange step can be included in a Before block(hook).
Consider including comments defining each section to ease readability.

```typescript
// arrange, set up the initial conditions for the test
// create a property
await createProperty()

// act, perform the action that you want to test 
// raise a charge
// this could involve calling methods or functions defined in your page objects
await raiseCharge()

// assert, verify that the action had the expected outcome 
// confirm charge has been raised
expect(charge).toBe('raised')
```

## Page Object Model (POM)

Every page should possess one POM file to enhance maintainability and scalability of our tests. It should include all the selectors and functions which are needed to interact with the UI page or component(s).

All interactions should be done using the page objects, no selectors in your tests.

All assertions should be in your test, no assertion in the POM

DO üëç

```typescript
// POM file './pageOobjects/foo/'
// add all locators and functions related to the page. 
// allowing all tests to reuse 

import {expect, Locator, Page} from '@playwright/test';

export class FooPage {
    readonly errorMessage: Locator;

    constructor(page: Page) {
        this.page = page;
        this.errorMessage = page.locator('.error-message');
    }
}

// test file './steps/foo.ts'
import {FooPage} from './pageObjects/foo';

let fooPage: FooPage;

Then(
    'error message should be visible',
    async function ({page}) {
        const fooPage = new FooPage({page});
        await expect(fooPage.errorMessage).toBeVisible();
    }
)
```

DO NOT ‚öîÔ∏è
```typescript
// test file './steps/foo.ts'
// include locators directly in test
import { Locator, Page } from '@playwright/test';

Then(
    'error message should be visible',
    async function ({page}) {
        await expect(page.locator('.error-message')).toBeVisible();
    }
)
```

## Waiting:

We can avoid using any arbitrary waits until it is really, really necessary.

DO NOT ‚öîÔ∏è

```typescript
await page.waitForTimeout(5000)
```

This can cause flaky tests as we can rarely be certain the amount of wait time is enough. It can also unnecessarily increase the test run time. Instead, we can try:

DO üëç

```typescript
await page.goto(fooBarURL, {
    waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'
});
```

DO üëç

```typescript
const element = page.locator("some-locator-path");
element.waitFor({ visible: true });
```

DO üëç

```typescript
await fooPage.buttonFoo.click();
await expect(fooPage.titlePage).toBeVisible();
```

## Selectors

Avoid selectors tied to implementation and page structure.

Instead, we can prioritize the below, based on [testing-library guiding principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/#priority)

- `getByRole` (this aids accessibility, reflects how users and assistive technology perceive the page)

- `getByText`

- `getByTestId` (add them when needed)

DO NOT ‚öîÔ∏è

```javascript
page.locator('.opt-u > div > .summary > div:nth-child(4) > div')
```

DO üëç

```javascript
page.locator('#foo-button');
page.getByText('OK');
```

## Naming Conventions

### Files and folders
- **Files**: Declare in **_camelCase_**
- **Folders**: Declare in **_kebab-case_**

### Variables

Declare in **_camelCase_**.

### Booleans

Start with ‚Äòis‚Äô, ‚Äòhas‚Äô, ‚Äòare‚Äô, ‚Äòhave‚Äô. This helps spot that this is a boolean while skimming the code. Still declared in ***camelCase***.

```typescript
let isTurnedOn = false
```
### Page Objects / Classes

Declare in **_PascalCase_**.

Use descriptive naming, which can help the reader quickly identify what page or page component this is covering. Use as much context as needed from your product to make the name meaningful.

DO NOT ‚öîÔ∏è

```typescript
export class newModal
```

DO üëç

```typescript
export class AddWorksOrderModal
```

### Locators

Use descriptive naming, which can help the reader quickly identify what element the locator is targeting.

As an example, you can use a naming structure that contains ***‚Äúaction / name of element‚Äù + ‚Äútype of element‚Äù***.

***Defining type of element*** - These are your basic HTML element types, they‚Äôll be defined and named in the design system, or as a team you can align on a consistent naming of the elements. Example: checkbox, tickbox, button, tooltip

***Defining action / name -*** Think about what action this element will perform when interacted with. Or any existing name/text of the element

DO üëç

```typescript
// This element is a submit button for the user registration form
const submitButton = await page.locator("<locator-path>");
```

DO üëç

```typescript
// This element is a button for uploading a profile picture
const uploadProfilePictureButton = await page.locator("<locator-path>");
```

### Function names

Always start function names with a ***‚Äúverb‚Äù***, followed by the ***‚Äúcomponent context‚Äù*** that the function is interacting with i.e. what entity it is having an effect on.

DO üëç

```typescript
getWorksOrder()
printTransactions()
deleteProperty()
```

## Gherkin Syntax
This [ownCloud developer manual](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/next/developer_manual/testing/acceptance-tests.html#how-to-write-acceptance-tests) provides comprehensive guidelines and best practices for writing acceptance tests using the Gherkin syntax, a widely adopted language for defining test scenarios in a human-readable format. The manual outlines the specific syntax and structure required when crafting feature files and scenarios to ensure consistency and maintainability within the ownCloud testing framework.
